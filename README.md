This started as a part of an assignment for the coure "ES 335 Machine Learning" at IIT Gandhinagar. I worked on it as part of a team of 4, you can check out the original repository [here](https://github.com/Aryan-IIT/es335-24-fall-assignment-1). This is an extension of the third task, where we implemented decision trees from scratch. The aim is to improve on that original work and give it all the functionalities that the sk-learn version provides.
